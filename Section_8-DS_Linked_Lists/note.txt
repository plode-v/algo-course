Linked list is basically lists that linked together by nodes
Each nodes have value and next
next is connected to the next node's value and if it's at the end of the list, then next = null

examples:

singly linked lists
head = { value: 10, next: { value: 2, next: null } }
tail = { value: 2, next: null }

Doubly Linked Lists
head = { value: 10, prev: null, next: { value: 2, prev: [Object], next: null } }
tail = { value: 2, prev: { value: 10, prev: null: next: [Object] }, next: null }
